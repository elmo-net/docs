# Documentation of Elmo-Net

Welcome to the documentation of Elmo-Net. This is intended to guide you through
the project, help you to understand it and get you started contributing if you
like to.

## Birds-Eye :airplane:

Elmo-Net is a functional library that is trying to make distributed games as
easy as possible. It provides a distributed hash-table based on the Kademlia
specification in the router project, which makes peer discovery easy. Other
projects try to adapt the mechanism to game engines so developers can get
started with the technology in the field they feel :sailboat: comfortable with.
